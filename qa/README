DeepSea integration test suite
==============================

The DeepSea integration suite residing in qa/ consists of a number of
executable files (bash scripts), all of which make the following assumptions:

1. there are at least two test nodes (VMs or physical machines) that are
   running the same OS (e.g. Leap 42.3) and can see eachother over the network. 
2. all the test nodes are configured as a Salt cluster, i.e.:
   a. one node is configured as both a master and a minion
   b. the remaining nodes are configured as minions only
   c. the master can "salt '*' test.ping" all the minions
3. the nodes have at least one external drive (>= 10GB) for OSD
4. the package repos have already been set up so DeepSea can install the RPMs
   it needs
5. the DeepSea code under test has already been installed (git clone ; make
   install) on the master node
6. the integration test script (this script) is run from the qa/ subdirectory
   of the DeepSea repo clone
